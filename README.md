# MPD-DJ-script

A script to change each track after a specified time... also starts each track after: 1:00mins

For MPD music terminal player!

A very nice gui to control mpd in android is MAFA, available at the playstore:

Im actually running mpd on Android with Termux... I use mpc and MAFA, which allows me to share my music/streams with anyone within 30 feet, each with their own headset/bluetooth device.
